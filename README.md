# Bank Helper
Bank Helper is a RuneLite plugin that overlays your bank with a color-coded heat map based on item value. Each item is colored on a gradient from blue (cheap) to 
  red (valuable) using the higher of its GE price or High Alchemy value, calculated on a log scale so the colors feel natural across a wide price range. Tradeable
  item stacks worth less than a configurable threshold are labeled JUNK. Untradeable items like quest items and uniques get their own distinct color to set them    
  apart from the gradient. All three gradient colors, the untradeable color, junk label color, fill opacity, and price thresholds are fully configurable.
